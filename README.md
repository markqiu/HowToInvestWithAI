To get the most out of this book, we recommend the following approach:

1. Sequential Reading: Start from the beginning and work your way through each chapter in order. The content is structured to build upon previous chapters.

2. Hands-on Practice: Each chapter includes practical exercises and code examples. We strongly encourage you to run these examples on your own machine to gain hands-on experience.

3. Project-Based Learning: As you progress through the book, work on a personal project applying the concepts you've learned. This could be creating an AI model for a specific asset class or market.

4. Supplementary Resources: Utilize the additional resources and references provided at the end of each chapter to deepen your understanding.
